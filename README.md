Life is not a bed of roses.
Everyone has their highs and lows throughout the day, and often people get bogged down easily over some petty issue.

SOULace is an exclusive innovation, which uses Microsoft's Emotion API along with Bing Search API, to transform the user's mood instantly!
It senses the user's current emotions, and offers a variety of leisure and self-help links to help the users cope up with their sadness, fear, grief etc. 
After detecting the emotion, we use Bing Search API to provide the users relevant videos, articles, songs, stories, images for upheavel from their present greiving state.
To act as your constant emotion companion, SOULace is equipped with a "Dear Diary" utility, to write down and contemplate about your present feelings.
Once you start using this app, it gets more and more addictive!

We made this app for the Microsoft Hackathon code.fun.do 2016.
